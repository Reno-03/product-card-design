# 📱 Smartphone Product Card Design

A clean and modern product card layout showcasing smartphone listings with interactive hover effects and responsive design.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a polished e-commerce product card interface featuring popular smartphone models. Built as part of my HTML/CSS learning journey, it focuses on creating reusable, visually appealing product cards with modern UI patterns.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern Card Design**: Clean, minimalist product cards with subtle shadows and borders
- **Interactive Hover Effects**: Smooth scale and shadow transitions on hover
- **Star Ratings**: SVG-based rating system for visual feedback
- **Pricing Display**: Original price, discount percentage, and current price
- **Responsive Layout**: Flexbox-based grid that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Custom SVG Icons**: FontAwesome icons for ratings, comments, and cart functionality

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup structure
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with Flexbox
- **SVG**: Scalable vector graphics for icons

## 📚 What I Learned

This project helped me practice and master:

1. **Flexbox mastery**: Creating flexible, responsive layouts without media queries
2. **CSS transitions**: Implementing smooth hover effects for better UX
3. **SVG integration**: Working with inline SVG icons from FontAwesome
4. **Box model**: Proper use of padding, margins, and borders
5. **Design replication**: Recreating a real-world product card design found online
6. **CSS filters**: Using `brightness()` for interactive button effects
7. **Aspect ratios**: Maintaining consistent image sizing with `aspect-ratio` property

## 🎨 Design Highlights

- **Color Scheme**: Light blue background (#E9F0FF) with white cards
- **Typography**: Clean Arial/Helvetica font stack
- **Spacing**: Consistent use of gaps and padding for visual hierarchy
- **Interactions**: 1.05x scale transform on hover with shadow enhancement
